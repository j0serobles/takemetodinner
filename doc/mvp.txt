                                               Take Me To Dinner
The purpose of the "Take Me To Dinner" application is to  bring people together for dinner at a restaurant.  The inten-
ded audience for the application are persons that want to go to dinner to one of their favorite restaurants but have
no one to share dinner with: 
-- Someone with nothing to do and wants to go to dinner.
-- Single persons, lonely or bored persons. 
-- Someone from out of town that wants to visit a local restaurant. 

At a minimum, the application provides  this functionality:
1) Allows a person to create a "request for dinner" with the following attributes:
 - Person name
 - Person location (City).
 - Short Bio
 - List of favorite restaurants.
 - Picture

2) Lists all the active dinner requests that have been created by users. 
3) Allow a user to respond to a dinner request by providing their contact details in a dinner request. 
4) Notify the dinner request creator via e-mail when someone responds to a request. 


Future functionality (Project "icebox" cards) : 
-- Maps (Geolocation) for Persons and Restaurants 
-- Conversation-style communication (message send/respond).
-- Criminal Records Search/ Backgrond Search API integration.
-- Person/Dinner Partner rating.
-- Restaurant rating. 
-- User Accounts
-- Provide Calendar where user can specify when they want to be taken out to dinner. 
-- "Put Your Ad Here" (Monetize)
